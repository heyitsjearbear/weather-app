# weather-app
Built a weather app using OpenWeather's 5 Day/3 Hour Forecast API. This was my first project working with API.
User is able to enter in any city into the search bar, and the API will fetch weather data based on inputted city.
I had a lot of fun working on this project!
DISCLAIMER: Some measurements might be a little off, as I had to utilize the free version of the API, so I was limited
on accuracy, yet this weather app gives a good idea on what the temperature will look of the inputted location.
